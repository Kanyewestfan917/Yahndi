# Yahndi
### This is the full compleated version of the unrelesed kanye album "Yahndi"!

## How It Was Leaked
### In mid-August 2019, several leaked versions of Kanye West's album 'Yandhi' began circulating, including a 28-minute leak on YouTube that compiled nine demos and recordings, presumably from sessions for Yandhi. Another leaked version of Yandhi appeared on Spotify under the name KANYE DROP YOUR ALBUMS, with no word on who uploaded the tracks. The music label claiming ownership is called "Faygo Records." The album was later scrapped. G.O.O.D. Music president and rapper Pusha-T criticized the leak on Twitter.
